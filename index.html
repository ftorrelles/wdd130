        BogotÃ¡, the capital of Colombia, is a vibrant city nestled high in the
        Andes at 2,640 meters above sea level. Known for its rich history,
        cultural diversity, and dynamic urban life, BogotÃ¡ blends colonial charm
        in its historic district, La Candelaria, with modern skyscrapers and
